# Bilateral Mixed Reality With Arduino
 Interaction between Quest 3 and the Esp32 Wifi module to to have dinamic interaction between virtual objects and physical objects powered by Arduino.
 
 By using http requests to the server it's possible to communicate a wide variety of information to Arduino. This can be used to have physical reactions to virtual actions. For this experiment, the simulation of a space capsule being sent to space and docking will be developed as a use case. Initial interactions with Arduino could be considered with the use of servos, lights, reles, buttons, piezos, buzzers, joystick, etc.

 A 1:1 scale environment for the capsule would be modeled in Maya to the replicate the virtual environment. This would have to be constructed in real life, so this is an important consideration when modeling. The final environment should be easily replicable and buildable to reduce expenses.
